Destination Categories: Tourist destinations are categorized based on types such as historical sites, natural wonders, religious places, etc., for easy navigation.
Detailed Information: Each destination page provides detailed information including description, location, visiting hours, entry fees, and nearby accommodations.
Search Functionality: Users can search for specific destinations using keywords or filters.
Responsive Design: The application is responsive and works seamlessly across various devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
# Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for creating dynamic and interactive components.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the project, allowing for rapid development and customization.

React Router: Used for managing navigation within the React application, enabling seamless transitions between different pages.

API Integration: Integrating with external APIs to fetch real-time data about tourist destinations, ensuring up-to-date information for users.

Responsive Design: Utilizing media queries and responsive design principles to ensure the application is accessible and functional across various devices.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
